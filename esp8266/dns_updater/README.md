# DNS Updater for Wemos D1 Mini
This short arduino app is written specifcally to update
a NameCheap DNS record every 15 minutes. It provides
feedback visually through the built in LED, and is also
set up to ping a healthcheck during its loop. The health
check is merely to provide notification if there is an
issue with the Wemos D1 Mini.
